### Data Cleaning/Preparation

  In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

  1.	Data loading and Inspection
  2.	Handling missing values
  3.	Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the sales data to answer important business questions such as:

-	What is the overall sales trend?
-	Which products are top sellers? 
-	What are the peak sales period?

### Data Analysis

Some interesting codes/ features worked with 

```python
sales_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/Nasa/Databank Analysis/Dataframes/sales.csv")
```
```python
sales_df.columns = [i.lower() for i in sales_df.columns]
```
```sql
get_sales = 'select * from sales'
sales_df = pd.read_sql(get_sales, conn)
```

### Results/Findings

The following are the summary of the analysis:

1.	The supermarket sales has been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday seasons
2.	Product category cloths, sockets, and Phones are the best performing category in terms of sales and revenue generation
3.	Customer segment with high live time value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts

### Recommendations

Based on the just concluded analysis, we here by recommended the following actions:

-	Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue
-	Focus on expanding and promoting products categories cloths, sockets, and phones
-	Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high LTV customers effectively

### Limitations

I have to remove all missing values and zeros from Tuesday to Friday columns because they would have impacted the accuracy of my result or conclusion from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the verifications but even then, we can still see that there is a positive correlation between daily sales and products.
